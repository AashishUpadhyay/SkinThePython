# Q: Amazon warehouses have a number of loading docks which are used for loading/unloading
# of items from van/semi. Given arrival and departure time for each vehicle, find the minimum number of loading docks required to be built in
# Amazon warehouse such that no truck has to wait for a free dock.

# Example:
# Input = [[1,2],[1.5,2.5],[2,2.5]]
# Output = 2 docks

# # [1,2],[1.5,2.5] = 2
# # [1,2] [2,2.5] = 1, [1.5,2.5] [2,2.5] = 2

# # [1,2],[1.5,2.5] = 2
# # [1,2] [2,2.5] = 1, [1.5,2.5] [2,2.5] = 2

# Input = [[1,2],[0.5,2.5],[2,2.5]]

# Input = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
# Output = 1 dock

# Input = [[1,2],[1.5,2.5],[1.75, 2.5]]
# Output = 3 dock
